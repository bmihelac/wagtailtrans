=============================================================

This is a fork of `wagtailtrans <https://github.com/wagtail/wagtailtrans>`_ with the only purpose making the migration
from wagtailtrans to wagtail's new built-in interantionalization system (version 2.11+) and add wagtail-localize
as the translation frontend.

Getting Started with the Migration

Disclaimer
----------

This fork and the guide is provided by Carrot & Company which is in no relation to Torchbox and Wagtail. We just love
Wagtail and wanted to help with the migration to the new Wagtail version. We only made
changes which helps for the migrations, no additional features added and it is also not recommended for other use as
to migrate to wagtail-localize.
